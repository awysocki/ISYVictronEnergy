## Configuration

### Getting Your VRM API Token

1. **Log into VRM Portal**: Go to https://vrm.victronenergy.com
2. **Navigate to Preferences**: Click on "Preferences" (gear icon) in the main interface
3. **Go to Integrations**: Click on "Integrations" in the Preferences menu
4. **Generate Token**: Create a new API token (may be called "Personal Access Token" or "API Token")
5. **Copy Token**: Save this token - you'll need it for the NodeServer

**Note**: If you don't see API token options in Integrations, your VRM Portal account may need additional permissions. Contact Victron support if API access is not available.

### ðŸ”„ VRM Data Update Frequency

Understanding how VRM Portal updates data helps optimize your NodeServer polling settings:

#### ðŸ§­ Default Logging Interval
- Most systems log data to VRM at a default interval of **15 minutes**
- This can be adjusted in the GX device under:
  - **Settings** â†’ **VRM Portal** â†’ **Interval**

#### âš¡ Real-Time Data (Dashboard Mode)
- When viewing the VRM dashboard in real-time mode, data updates every **2 seconds**
- This mode increases CPU and bandwidth usage and is only active while the dashboard is open

#### ðŸ“¡ API Rate Limits
- The VRM API allows up to **3 requests per second** on average
- Rate limiting uses a rolling window of 200 requests, with one request removed every 0.33 seconds
- If exceeded, you'll get a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a `Retry-After` header

#### ðŸ§  Summary

| Mode | Update Frequency | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| Standard Logging | Every 15 minutes | Configurable in GX settings |
| Real-Time Dashboard | Every 2 seconds | Only while dashboard is open |
| API Access | Depends on endpoint | Rate-limited to ~3 req/sec |

ðŸ”„ VRM Data Update Frequency

### Configure the NodeServer

1. **In Polyglot**: Go to your ISYVictronEnergy NodeServer
2. **Configuration**: Click on "Configuration" 
3. **Add API Token**: Enter your VRM API token in the "VRM API Token" field
   - **Example**: `e03ec962d5209774e8b48e501396e2a8eddf073284dfb82086c6ba479a8b69a7`
   - **Important**: Save this token somewhere safe - you can only view it once in VRM Portal!
4. **Temperature Units** (Optional): Choose Celsius or Fahrenheit for battery temperature displays
5. **Save**: Save the configuration
6. **Restart**: Restart the NodeServer to apply changes

The NodeServer will automatically:
- **Without API token**: Create only the main "Victron Energy" node showing "Disconnected" status
- **With invalid token**: Show "Authentication Failed" status  
- **With valid token**: Connect to your VRM Portal, discover your installations, and find all devices
- **After connection**: Create nodes for Gateway, Battery Monitors, Solar Chargers, and Inverters
- **During operation**: Update all device data every 2 minutes with zero values indicating connection issues

### For Development:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/awysocki/ISYVictronEnergy.git

# Method A: Create ZIP for upload
# Method B: Copy to device
scp -r ISYVictronEnergy admin@your-device-ip:/home/admin/plugins/
```

**Note**: Replace `your-device-ip` with your ISY device's IP address.

## Troubleshooting

### **NodeServer Installation Issues**
- Ensure you have developer access from Universal Devices
- Check that all files are included in your installation package
- Verify Python dependencies install correctly (check Polyglot System Logs)
- Ensure the NodeServer is started and running in Polyglot

### **VRM Connection Issues**
**Controller shows "Disconnected" or "Authentication Failed":**
- Verify your VRM API token is correct and active
- Test API access using curl commands (see Testing API Access section)
- Ensure your Polyglot system has internet connectivity

**All device values show zero:**
- This is normal behavior when VRM connection fails
- Check Controller node status for connection state
- Verify your Cerbo GX/Venus GX is online in VRM Portal
- Check VRM Portal for any account or permission issues

### **Device Discovery Issues**
**Expected devices not appearing:**
- Verify devices are connected and visible in VRM Portal
- Check that devices are properly configured in your Victron system
- Some devices may require specific firmware versions for VRM data
- Battery monitors require proper shunt configuration

**Incomplete device data:**
- Some data points may not be available on all device models
- Check your specific device documentation for supported metrics
- Older firmware versions may have limited data availability

### **Data Update Issues**
**Stale or non-updating data:**
- Check NodeServer logs for API errors or rate limiting
- Verify your VRM Portal account has proper access to the installation
- Try restarting the NodeServer to reset API connections
- Check for VRM Portal maintenance or outages

### **Debug Information**
**Log Files** (accessible through Polyglot web interface):
- **System Logs**: Initial loading and Python errors
- **NodeServer Logs**: Runtime VRM API communication and device updates
- **VRM API Responses**: Detailed API response analysis for troubleshooting

**Manual Testing**: Use ISY Query commands on individual nodes to trigger immediate updates

**Connection Verification**: Check Controller node status first - all other issues stem from VRM connection problems
